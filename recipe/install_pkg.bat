:: we want clang to use the omp.h from this package, but stand-alone openmp doesn't
:: put this on clang's default search path. On unix we can use a symlink, but those
:: are not generally usable on windows. As a work-around, copy omp.h to the respective
:: paths for several likely clang versions. Since we have basically no constraints on
:: the version of `llvm-openmp`, environments will tend to have the newest one. In turn,
:: this means that the compiler version is (almost) always â‰¤ the openmp version, hence
:: it suffices to loop until the major version here. We start from clang 18, because
:: https://github.com/conda-forge/clangdev-feedstock/pull/345 is not backported further.
